# About the Reloaded License

!!! tip "For commercial applications requiring a custom licence, please contact [admin@sewer56.dev](mailto:admin@sewer56.dev) ([GitHub](https://github.com/Sewer56))."

!!! info "This project and most Reloaded projects are governed by the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licences/gpl-3.0.en.html) licence."

This is a FAQ meant to clarify the licensing choice and its implications.

Please note, though, that the full licence text is the final legal authority.

## Why was GPL v3 chosen?

!!! tip "The primary objective is to prevent closed-source, commercial exploitation of the project."

We want to ensure that the project isn't used within a proprietary environment for
profit-making purposes such as:

- Being sold behind a Patreon paywall.
- Being integrated into a closed-source commercial product for sale.

!!! success "The Reloaded Project is a labour of love from unpaid hobbyist volunteers."

    (At the time of writing, mostly one guy in a 3x3.5m room, who spent 1000s of hours holed up, running the project at a financial loss).

Exploiting that work for profit feels fundamentally unfair.

While the GPLv3 licence doesn't prohibit commercial use outright, it does prevent commercial
exploitation by requiring that contributions are given back to the open-source community.

In that fashion, everyone can benefit from the projects under the Reloaded label.

## Can I use Reloaded Libraries Commercially?

You can as long as the resulting produce is also licenced under GPLv3, and thus open source.

## Can I use Reloaded Libraries in a closed-source application?

!!! note "The licence terms do not permit this."

However, if your software is completely non-commercial, meaning it's neither
sold for profit, funded in development, nor hidden behind a paywall (like Patreon),
we will probably just look the other way.

This often applies to non-professional programmers, learners, or those
with no intent to exploit the project. We believe in understanding and
leniency for those who might not know better.

GPL v3 exists to protect the project and its contributors. If you're not exploiting the project for commercial
gain, you're not hurting us; and we will not enforce the terms of the GPL.

If you are interested in obtaining a commercial licence, or want an explicit written exemption,
please get in touch with the repository owners.

!!! tip "GPL obligations apply only to recipients of your software"

    Internal development doesn't require publishing sources to the outside world.

## Can I link Reloaded Libraries statically/dynamically?

Yes, as long as you adhere to the GPLv3 licence terms, you're permitted to statically
link Reloaded Libraries into your project through various linking approaches.

## Attribution (Optional)

!!! info "While not legally required under GPL v3, attribution is greatly appreciated."

Attribution helps recognise contributor efforts and supports the open-source community:

- Mention your project uses Reloaded libraries (in readme, credits, or documentation)
- Link back to the Reloaded Project when possible

Thank you for your support! 👉👈
