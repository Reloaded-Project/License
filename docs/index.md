# Reloaded License

This wiki exists to answer licensing questions for the Reloaded Project and provide the complete licence texts.

## About Reloaded

The Reloaded Project provides free modding tools and libraries, started and mostly written by [Sewer56][sewer56-github].

!!! info "The Reloaded Project is a labour of love from unpaid hobbyist volunteers."

    At the time of writing, mostly one guy in a 3x3.5m room, who spent 1000s of hours holed up, running the project at a financial loss.

This documentation serves as the central licensing reference, linked from Reloaded repositories across the project.
